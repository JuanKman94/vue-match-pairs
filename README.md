# vue-match-pairs

A memory match-pairs game implementation with Vue. Inspired by
[this](http://www.kielack.com/games/memory.php) vanilla JS implementation.

Awesome roll over effects thanks to [codepo8](https://github.com/codepo8),
mostly based on [this](http://thewebrocks.com/demos/cuberollovers/).
